Scripts for training ResNet-152 on an image dataset of Austrian butterfly and moth species for a master thesis in the ULG data science of the University of Innsbruck. A link to the thesis will be added when it is published. 

The scripts were run on the EuroHPC supercomputer LEONARDO, hosted by CINECA (Italy) and the LEONARDO consortium that was accessed through an EuroHPC Development Access call. 

Andreas Lindner of EuroCC Austria contributed to the script, adapting it for high performance computing and adding the parallelization to reduce training time. 

The model was trained on a dataset with over 500,000 images of butterflies and moths that were collected by citizen scientists with the application "Schmetterlinge Österreichs" of the foundation "Blühendes Österreich".
